## Welcome

Restrainite is a [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for 
[Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows others to control restrictions of the local user. 

With the current use of dynamic variables, it's not possible to restrict the access. Anyone in
your game world can toggle it. Please keep that in mind and use the options in the extensive settings menu.
There is currently no known way to restrict this based on user ids or similar, because of how the FrooxEngine works. 
(PRs welcome!) We might add an option to use cloud variables in the future.

## Beta Release

We are currently polishing up the mod and expect a release within January 2025.

## Features

Information will be provided on beta launch.

## Why does this exist?

There are people who have various reasons for wanting certain features of the game disabled. A lot of these features 
can also be disabled through other means like Protoflux and could be seen as malicious, because then they could be 
applied to anyone. Those in-game items already exists. In NeosVR there also existed the NeosNoEscape mod, with similar 
objectives.

Some features can't be disabled with in-game code, so people could try to find in-game exploits to achieve their goal.
This presents a strong incentive to not report any security exploits they find. The primary motivation behind this mod 
is not to remove safety features, but give people a consenting choice to disable them.

If someone is using this mod maliciously, this a moderation issue.
