> Restrainite is a [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for 
> [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows others to control restrictions of the local user. 
>
> Restrainite is currently in **Beta**, there will still be changes to the behaviour, features and how it will
> interact with Resonite. The current feature set is somewhat stable and has already been tested over the last two months.

{: .important }
With the current use of dynamic variables, it's not possible to restrict the access by others. Anyone in
your game world can toggle it. Please keep that in mind and use the options in the extensive settings menu.
There is currently no known way to restrict this based on user ids or similar, because of how the FrooxEngine and 
the network protocol works. (PRs welcome!) We might add an option to use cloud variables in the future.

## Support

## Why does this exist?
There are people who have various reasons for wanting certain features of the game disabled. A lot of these features 
can also be disabled through other means like Protoflux and could be seen as malicious, because then they could be 
applied to anyone. Those in-game items already exists. In NeosVR there also existed the NeosNoEscape mod, with similar 
objectives.

Some features can't be disabled with in-game code, so people could try to find in-game exploits to achieve their goal.
This presents a strong incentive to not report any security exploits they find. The primary motivation behind this mod 
is not to remove safety features, but give people a consenting choice to disable them.

If someone is using this mod maliciously, this a moderation issue.
